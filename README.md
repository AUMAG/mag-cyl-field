## Mathematica files

While the typeset version of the paper presents the derivations and final solutions,
these are likely to be more accessible for re-use in the following Mathematica documents:

* [Nomenclature.wl](https://github.com/AUMAG/mag-cyl-field/blob/main/Nomenclature.wl)
* [Analytic solutions with numeric comparison.nb](https://github.com/AUMAG/mag-cyl-field/blob/main/Analytic%20solutions%20with%20numeric%20comparison.nb)

There is a typeset PDF version of the latter notebook, but please note that the code is truncated at the page edge so it is intended purely for illustrative purposes.
